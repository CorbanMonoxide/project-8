Vibing out on a collection management platform

An app that could just wrap up all your shit in one place would be pretty sweet. It could be locally hosted on a server and be accessible over internet from anywhere. You could have as many categories as you'd like and you could have AI scan it, identify it, provide a list of imdb links, pricechart links, tcgplayer.com links, and have a link to the list of active listings for the item on ebay. You could customize the gui super easily and develop a web interface using one of the javascript frameworks. You're basically just managing a database and choosing how to present data. Then you could have like a digital space within the app to display covers and whatnot.

import your entire list of physical media and you could import your entire digital collection and those could be linked or displayed seperately (Like a filter for digitial/physical or both) then you could go to the page for your movie/tv show or whatever and click "Watch Now" and use VLC's command line tools to automatically open a player within the app, that's just vlc, and control it from there.

When you scan an item, it shows you the list of links and options and you can confirm which one is actually it or manually add if it's super niche and hard to find and add info for the item. Then a page gets created with the all the information, price charting, location in your library, play now link.
You could even remove friction from selling an item by including a "Sell Now" button that would open your selling page on ebay lol.
